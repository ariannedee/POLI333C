Half of in-class voting simulation program written in Javascript using Google Chart Tools. This half displays the social and economic preferences of the user, the parties, and the other students as locations on an xy coordinate with range [-10, 10]. It also displays the supporters who voted for a particular party. The other half (I don't have the code), allowed students to vote in a simulated election for the parties presented with a specified electoral system.

Without connection to server and other half of the program, this code should just display a sample student's location and preset party locations. You can change the party locations but showing supporters for each party should not highligt anything.
